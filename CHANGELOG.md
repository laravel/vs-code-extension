## [0.1.16]

### Added

- PHP Environment setting. Specify your local environment via a list of common local setups.
- Broadened the scope of `config` values to include top level files and top-level array keys

### Fixed

- Auto-detection of Sail and running PHP scripts via Sail
- Bug where second parameter of `config()` was autocompleting, linking, hovering, and validating
- Removed hardcoded `env` values from `launch.json` to allow users to contribute more easily
- File watcher paths as configured by `config/inertia.php`
- Missing Inertia views quick fix now respects the paths as configured by `config/inertia.php`
- Hovering and linking for Windows users with incorrect filepaths
- Removed error popups when the codebase had a parser error (during active editing)

## [0.1.15]

- Fixed issue with executing binary on Windows path with spaces
- Repo file watchers are now debounced to prevent CPU from spiking
- Extension should now output cleaner errors from mini scripts so that future issues will be easier to debug

## [0.1.14]

- Fixed fallback for running PHP code (mentioned in 0.1.13 as a breaking change). The note in the last changelog was incorrect: the new PHP Command setting should just read `php`, meaning the file will just be added to the end of the command.

## [0.1.13]

- Initial Windows support
- Fixed nullable param for translations template for PHP 8.4
- Fixed undefined GLOB_BRACE for translations template
- Fix for Eloquent model info when `phpDocumentor` wasn't installed

- Remove `.github` from bundle ([#29](https://github.com/laravel/vs-code-extension/pull/29))
- Inspired by [#20](https://github.com/laravel/vs-code-extension/pull/20), Inertia paths are now read from the existing PHP config in the project
- **Breaking**: The setting for PHP Command is now changed to run a file, not inline code. Previously this would have looked like this: `php -r "{code}"` but should now look like this `php "{code}"`

## [0.1.12]

- Now fetching OS/arch specific binaries for Mac and Linux (Windows coming soon)
- Fixed translation loading when there were _a lot_ of translations
- Fixed an issue regarding full name resolution for scoped property access

## [0.1.11]
